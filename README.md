# Leveraging Data Analytics for Sales Optimization and Revenue Growth
In the intensely competitive world of online retailing, organizations like Amazon must determine which product aspects drive sales performance. When assessing how well a product sells, factors including pricing, customer rating, product category, and discount are critical. The difficulty, though, is in properly evaluating these variables to produce better choices that increase revenue and satisfy customers.
The objective of this project is to determine which product attributes such as category, price, rating, and discount have the most effects on the performance of sales. Additionally, we want to know how to best optimize discount percentages to maximize customer ratings and sales volume across a range of product categories.
